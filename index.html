Question 1: Where are the aliens?
<p class="doublespace">


In a universe filled with countless planets that life may have developed on, it almost seems strange that we have yet to see any signs of alien life.
<br>
<br>
Entertain this modified Zoo hypothesis: The zoo hypothesis assumes first that a large number of alien cultures exist, and second that these aliens have great reverence for independent, natural evolution and development. In particular, assuming that intelligence is a physical process that acts to maximize the diversity of a system's accessible futures, a fundamental motivation for the zoo hypothesis would be that premature contact would "unintelligently" reduce the overall diversity of paths the universe itself could take.
<br>
<br>
Assuming these other alien civilizations are ages ahead of us in technology, they may already know that the survival of our universe in a multi-verse of realities relies on the number of quantum probabilities of the rest of the universe's timeline. If an alien civilization made contact with us, it would in theory "dumb us down" since instead of naturally discovering things through our human intelligence, we would just be cheating and using alien technology, a pre-discovered technology, therefore limiting/decreasing the possible futures of our reality.
<br>
<br>
These ideas are perhaps most plausible if there is a relatively universal cultural or legal policy among a plurality of extraterrestrial civilizations necessitating isolation with respect to civilizations at Earth-like stages of development. In a universe without a hegemonic power, random single civilizations with independent principles would make contact. This makes a crowded Universe with clearly defined rules seem more plausible.﻿

Question 2: Why is biological intelligence irrational?

<p class="doublespace">
	You may have heard how any mathematical analysis of "classical" human logic is fruitless; Our thoughts and actions are counterintuitive to all of classical probability theory. Humans are illogical creatures, and nobody knows why. This is why statements like "You cannot predict the market" are very common on wall street. Our entire economy is encapsulated in a numerical system of scoring abstract entities, such as company shares, based on how humans are going to expect them to perform. There is no mathematics that can tell you exactly whether a stock will go up or down, no matter how much information you have, simply because the price of the stock is determined by it's perception by other traders, humans, who cannot be perfectly logical all the time, and who also carry an encrypted black-box of thoughts inside their minds that are inaccessible. The sum of all of these black boxes of every human in the US (and other important foreign investors) determines the will of the market. If people feel as if the market is going to crash, they dump their assets, and as a result cause a market crash simply for assuming that it will crash. On the other hand, if the majority of people believe that the market will surge, they will buy up shares and drive the prices of those shares up, in turn boosting the economy. 
<br>
<br>
	Let me give you an example on this contradicting nature of human thought: One person can care about animals , love them, and never have the capacity to ever kill a living breathing animal, and yet they can eat meat with a clear conscience. Logically, a person that eats cow KNOWS they are eating something that was living and breathing.. Logically, if the person knows that animals are killed for him to consume meat, it would be expected that they would experience the same amount of guilt for eating the animal (commutative property), and this is where mathematics and logic break down and human constructs of psychology emerge. This creates an illogical paradox. If you created a computer algorithm that decided whether someone is vegan or a meat-eater based on whether they would kill or wouldn't kill a cow with a hammer, your study would most likely be fruitless with no correlation, even though we have noticed a logical commutative property between eating an animal and contributing to its death. Unless the individual is directly involved with the killing of the animal, all the emotions and images of the animal being slaughtered in the mind of the eater don't appear, because there is a disconnect between a living thing and food that culture has ingrained in us, even though there is a clear rational connection between the death of the animal and the eater. The meat-eater obviously knows that something has to die for it to be on its plate, and yet the experience of killing something versus eating it is completely different. If an alien force loved humans, surely they wouldn't eat them? Ironically, someone that would kill a cow with a hammer would be now dubbed a "psychopath", yet when you look at the logic of things, they did nothing wrong, since you are killing a cow every time you eat a hamburger. This computational way of thinking is what exists in the minds of psychopaths, where they only see other humans as just numbers. We would call a psychopath as "irrational", even though in their head, everything checks out mathematically. The fact that we would call the math of the logic irrational, is proof of the irrationallity of thought.
<br>
<br>
Why does loving something preclude eating it? Because loving and killing are logically contradictory. Emotions have no basis in classical logic. They are entities of their own. That is why emotions make a person illogical more often than not. Imagine for a second we live in a perfectly logical universe (classically logical). If you have a positive feeling about something, it would be completely illogical to perform any action that contributes to the destruction of that something. And yet we do it anyways, because we humans supersede classical logic. We function beyond the realm of mathematics, at least the mathematics that we have learned. You probably know a lot of people yourself that hold these contradicting thoughts. Whether it's political opinions or food preference. 
<br>
<br>
A realization has come to me a while ago: Modern physics describes our reality as a four dimensional entity, because we can move, for something to have the property of changing position over time, it would need the property of time as well. Fourth dimension simply refers to the concept of time .
<br>
<br>
Another concept in physics is the concept of superposition of particles. A particle has spin (e.g. electron can have up-spin or down-spin, a description of its state, doesn't really have anything analogous to an object spinning. Every particle is made of three quarks. These quarks have charges. The particle is determined to be up-spin or down-spin based on the charge and masses of its quarks, and each quark contains its own unique identifiers based on mass, and charge. If it has more top-quarks than bottom-quarks, for example, the particle is considered up-spin. Think of it simply as the binary choice of existence of each particle, it either chooses up, or down.
<br>
<br>
Now here is the spooky stuff: A particle exists in a superposition of both states/spins, until it is measured, then it collapses into a definite position of either 1 or 0, upspin or downspin. It is as if these quarks inside the particles don't exist (aka aren't born yet). This is known as the particle-wave duality. What is measurement you may ask? It is probing an entity for information. If you have gathered any type of information about an observation, you have completed a measurement. This is analogous to particles, as it is to the real world. If you check your speedometer, the information your brain receives is the speed of your vehicle, a piece of information that your brain did not have before. The "undecidedness" on the speed of your vehicle, in your head, is now "decided" on, for example, 25 miles per hour. Suddenly, any feelings of worry of getting pulled over diminish, as the probabilities of your possible futures of getting pulled over, in your mind, suddenly decreases, since you logically deduce that going under the speed limit is the right thing to do. Your mind is literally computing Feynman Path Integrals on the go. If you open a door to your fridge to see if you have yogurt, you are probing the fridge for information, and you are completing a measurement. You may or may not have yogurt, the only way to find out is to go probe the fridge, or ask your wife. Your fridge contains super-position yogurt. (This is analogous to Schrodingers Cat experiment). Now if you ask your wife if the fridge has yogurt, it is almost as if, in the realm of your mind, the scale of uncertainty of the existence of this yoghurt is tipped more towards "existence". Even if you haven't looked in the fridge for days, you can extract accurate (if she is trustworthy) information from a biological library that waltzes around. If you really think about it, it really is phenomenal, how information is non-local, and moves around through us. Everything humans have ever invented is the fruition of attempts to connect information over distance.
<br>
<br>
It is as if your mind is a quantum computer that is constantly calculating based on the information it has available, and manifests "feelings" based on the availability of information, as a system for gauging the future state of your existence, as well as a driving force to generate unique biases on every individual to maximize the complexity and intelligence of a system. If you feel sick, it is an indicator of the future possibilities of you, either throwing up or dying, or etc... If you are in love, you feel like the future is endless and joyful. Feelings are also what control you, what drive you to do something even if you logically wouldn't. At the essence, it is what breaks the system of p-complete nature (another math term for deterministic system; A problem/system is p-complete if the end-state can be determined by the starting conditions, in polynomial time. Analogous to a clock-work universe, with no free-will.) A universe that constantly repeats the same exact timeline would be boring. It is as if emotions are simply another factor to provide a diverse range of timelines for our universe, since as we have seen, emotions need not follow any mathematical structure, they can be completely illogical. Introducing this randomness is key to free will. Another interesting thing to mention is, that in mathematics, "true randomness" is theoretically impossible. This is an interesting thought experiment. Try to imagine a way to generate a random number simply via addition, subtraction, and multiplication. You can't. As long as someone can see the order of operations you performed on a number, they will know the algorithm of your random-number generator, therefore proving that your number is infact, not random. Now think about black holes. Informational stack-overflows of destruction. Particles flow into black holes and never escape. Total information-loss is what creates randomness; It is as if you wrote down the operations you performed to create a random number, and then you burned the piece of paper that depicted those operations. This is similar to the way your mind functions. How often do you think of a great idea, but you can't recall the memories and thoughts that led you up to that idea? Your mind creates these instantanious thoughts that last milliseconds, shuffles through them, and judges which ones are more important based on the circumstance. If asked you, how did I come up with the (random) number 548, you wouldn't have an answer. Your mind is like a black hole, that only your ego/identity exists in. No one else has a clue of the operations my mind performed to come up with the number 548, hell I don't even know, because the thoughts that you extracted the random sequence from are so fast that you don't even notice it. Thoughts that pop in and out of existence, and you are the decider of what thoughts to hang onto, and which thoughts to pay no attention to. Almost like Hawking Radiation; Virtual particles pop in and out of existence all the time, and the event horizon of black holes theoretically pulls apart these virtual particles from their anti-particles, and pulls them into "real" existence, resulting as Hawking Radiation. This is why our mind is a black box, akin to a black hole.
<br>
<br>
If we didn't have emotions, we would act more on mathematical based logic. This is evident in drugs like adderall (as well as studied socio/psychopaths) which appear to cut the link between the part of your brain that manifests emotions and the part of your brain that plans for a task. ADHD, for example, is a disorder of the brain where there is an over-connection between these two parts of the brain, which result in over-emotion, which results in anxiety if this over-emotion is a bad emotion, which consequently results in procrastination. Your negative "feelings" about the consequences of not completing a task manifest as procrastination. If you didn't have negative feelings about completing the task, you would be indifferent to starting the task now or later, which aderall accomplishes by drowning out negative feelings/anxiety with positive feelings/pure dopamine. Emotions are what give humans insight into whether they should do something or not, based on past experiences, rather than cold hard calculations. If you are purely random, you are psychotic. If you are purely mathematically rational/calculated, you are most likely a sociopath. If you have an error within your emotions, you may have autism. It is this balance between emotions and rationality that make humans "normal".
<br>
<br>
They say emotions is what makes you alive. That is why someone that is emotionless is sometimes called "lifeless". If someone acts purely logically 100% of the time, they would be a computer, aka a lifeless automata that follows math operations of comparison.
<br>
<br>
Now, moving onto intelligence. Intelligence can be interpreted as the amount of accessible futures that a system has (as I have talked about in the previous post). The more intelligent something is, the more "creativity" it usually has for finding viable solutions to a problem; It thinks in more unique way, and uniqueness is a derivative of randomness; The definition of true randomness is how unique (non-pattern-like) the information is (and to-date, the only truley random occurance in our universe is the outcome of the collapse of quantum particles, keep this in mind for later). Think of it like an analogy for a good president- An intelligent president will be able to come up with many many solutions to a problem, before resorting to war. An unintelligent president/leader will usually resort to war if the only solution he could come up with fails. The president that has many solutions to a problem, his reality will split into a every reality where he chose every solution he came up with, and they either work out or don't. The unintelligent president will get much fewer splits in reality; One reality where he attempts solution 1, and one reality where he resorts to war. One may ask, which one of these realities is the basis for comparison? I'd have to say, the one we are currently experiencing, since it seems our reality is something of an interpolation of every quantum possibility deduced into one of the more probable realities.
<br>
<br>
This concept in the last paragraph has a lot to do with infinities. There lies an infinite number of quantum-splits of realities, in theory, but many of these realities are nonsensical and extremely unlikely. There exists a bigger infinity of realities for the most likely event to occur, and smaller infinity for realities that are very improbable. It would not be logical if the president suddenly developed superpowers and saved the planet, so every variation of that reality, is part of these smaller infinities. Human emotion is analogous to Feynman's Path Integral formula. How Feynman figured out the most likely path for a particle to take from point A to point B in quantum-physics is to subtract all the infinities of every path taken from themselves. What emerges is only the most probable infinities, and the most likely path for that particle to take. Our brains are also calculating future outcomes, performing this operation of weighing which outcome will be more certain, by comparing all the probable and non probable outcomes, and our emotion emerges based on the impact of the outcome on our life. Imagine for a moment that the number 4 is infinite, as well as the number 3. Because our minds are able to calculate these simple mathematics with ease, we know 4 is greater than 3 without much thought. Imagine now you have infinite intelligence. Every infinity suddenly because just another number 4 and number 3 and your emotions are now manifested from the paradoxes of even larger infinities. Emotions are simply the measure of "confidence" a system has, because many emotions manifest out of "knowing" that there is an unknown. Although now, your emotions are much more accurate and much more precise in generating a "feeling" of what will happen in the future, so your "confidence" is up. This is why everything biological is drawn to "confident" leaders; confidence appears to be the indicator of a system's ability to be certain about the future. We are drawn to determinism, we hate not knowing something. Your mother gets into a crash, is she dead or alive? You must know, because the outcome of your mother living or dying will drastically change the course of your future timeline. This psychological tension is the driver for many movies and books. Maybe this is why people with low intelligence have a link with confidence; they simply do not know that they don't know jack shit. A false sense of knowing. Truly intelligent people would be in a state of shock, if they really understood how unknowable our existence is (big factor why anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder are much higher in individuals with higher intelligence). 
<br>
<br>
Another example I want to demonstrate of the np-hard nature of reality is how simply the arrangement of the order of events in the dimension of time creates a problem similar to problems found in protein-folding. Imagine this; A 30 year old woman is being interviewed. The first question the interviewer asks is, "are you happy?". The woman replies yes. The interviewer then asks, "are you married"? And the woman replies no. Even though she is not married, she is happy. Now, simply flipping the order of these questions creates a paradox. If the interviewer asked if the woman is married first, and her reply was no, the answer to the next question will now have a higher likely chance of replying "No" as well, because the woman now assumes to the societal expectations of happiness (which include marriage), and she begins to doubt her happiness. It is almost like if the quantum wave function probability distribution of her response to the second question is altered, simply by the "measurement" of her mind, about the topic of relationships. Now the probabilities of her answering no to the 2nd question become much higher, caused by this measurement of her answer to the relationship status question first. It appears that this balance between logic and emotion is what results in the most diverse number of accessible futures for a system; Too much logic without emotion and the system is a deterministic algorithm with only one future. Too much emotion and not enough logic has the same dilemma; A system will end up being uselessly random. Since emotion appears to be a controlling hard-wired driving mechanism of cognitive decision making to generate a "feeling" for an expected outcome, and as a result, the system will only stick to the patterns of previous experiences without calculated "hyper-awareness" critical thinking, and will provide a smaller number of accessible futures since contradicting emotions generated on previous experience provide no indicator of the future outcome (50/50 chance) if the situation is unique, therefore decreasing the ability of that system to survive unforseen events... This error is apparent in modern machine-learning algorithms; although they can intake an insane amount of data, they do not have "intuition", . This works for simple-logic applications such as image recognition, but fails for more complex systems such as attempting to predict future stock prices simply on previous numbers, since stock numbers are driven by human intellect, not the other way around. Machine learning algorithms are excellent at finding patterns and consistencies in things that are mathematically recurrent (which the human mind is not).
<br>
<br>
The point of this thought experiment was to demonstrate that the outcome of a scenario cannot be calculated, given the starting conditions. If the woman was a computer, she would act most logical, with a hierarchical form of thought, where she attributes values to certain variables, and these variables would have no reason to change, in theory, by simply changing the order of the questions. She would simply be a function of time, and if you input f(time), you would calculate the outcome at that point. If you are trying to argue that the order of questions has no influence on her outcome/answer, then you have assumed wrongly.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
This is a phenomena, of human thought. I said it is similar to protein folding in a way, because when supercomputers perform protein folding calculations, a protein sequence in position 52, impacts the angle of the protein at position 4, which in turn impacts the angle and orientation of the protein at position 32. You can see the dilemma here. This is extremely oversimplified, multiply this by 1,000 and you notice how difficult this problem becomes. You have no idea what the shape of the protein is simply by knowing its sequence, without REcalculating each fold, step by step, because the way the protein manipulates itself is non-linear. If the protein sequence was considered the variable of time in our universe, and the orientation of each protein (let us pretend that the angle of the protein is analogous to the outcome of an action in our reality) was dependent on the position of every protein before it and after it, then that is similar to the point of my argument: The order of questions impacts the future and past assumptions, which is contradictory to classical probability theory, but similar to quantum mechanics. Just as the orientation of protein in position 5 influences the orientation of the protein in position 2, it is similar to the fact that the question about her relationship(lets call this protein 4) was asked after the question about her overall happiness(lets call this protein 5), which shows that this event influenced her previous assumption about her overall happiness (lets call this protein 1). As you can see, the order of protein 4 and 5 influenced protein 1. If Protein 5 came before protein 4, the outcome of protein 1 would be completely different.
<br>
<br>
The logic of quantum mechanics is non-linear, since every "measurement" seems to affect past and future trajectories of particles. Similar to how in our mind, the past influences the future, and the future influences the past. That last statement makes perfect sense when thinking about our thoughts and emotions, but seems absurd when talking about reality, and yet quantum mechanics tells us this is the way the universe behaves.  
<br>
<br>
From this analysis of the links between psychology and quantum mechanics, it seems that nearly all of human existence can be deduced into these quantum characteristics of the nature of the very particles in the universe itself. As we observe a particle, we are also technically posing a question: Which spin orientation do you have, particle? And because there was no one there to ask the question before, the universe did not decide on a reply, so it was in a super-position of undecidedness prior to the question, analogous to an individual's opinion about the shape of a cloud; if you haven't looked at the cloud yet, you haven't formulated an opinion on it yet, aka you are undecided at that moment in time. There is no way to figure out your opinion on that cloud other than ask you, because your opinion simply doesn't exist prior to the question. Furthermore, even if you have looked at the cloud, you may not have considered the shape of it to looking like anything. Because someone asked you a question, you are forced to create this quantum collapse of your opinion to answer one of many possible answers, giving "birth" to a new thought in your head, that may lead you somewhere else. Just like the simple random act of Newton seeing an apple falling from the tree, resulted in a realization to change our entire understanding of physics.
<br>
<br>
With all of these points considered, I want you to consider something: If a quantum-computer intelligence emerges in the near future, it will be much more similar to human intelligence than modern AI; a properly programmed modern AI will still output a string of numbers to demonstrate the probability of an outcome. That is determinism. Anything physical is not fuzzy, and humans operate on "fuzzy" logic, just as all of matter operates on this "fuzzy" non-determinable spectrum of existence. As long as you can look at the AI's "certainty" output about an outcome, you will always know that it is exactly that, and no matter how much time passes, the AI's opinion will never change.. Humans can hate someone one day, and then forgive them the next. There is no 'certainty' in human thought, just as there is no certainty on the state of any given particle. If any intelligence functions, at the core, from the black-box nature of quantum uncertainty, it would mean that it shares many characteristics of complex life; Something that cannot be deduced to a set of equations, because of the very core of it, that defines something as intelligent, is having this non-determinstic incalculable / unknowable property to it, whilst still creating meaningful structure, just as our minds can generate random numbers (contributed by random quantum fluctuations, it's like the universe itself gives us the property of life/free-will, rather than resulting in automata).
<br>
<br>
Another dis-similarity between modern AI and humans, is that AI is the calculable process of maximizing utility. That is the basis for every single modern AI. Again, this is another mathematical algorithm that misses a key point, intuition. Completely deterministic, and contradictory to what I was talking about how human reason is non-deterministic. If you performed the interview thought experiment on the AI, no matter what order of questions you gave it, it would return the same exact answer, because the order of questions has no effect on a mathematical construct, because of the commutative property, something you learn in 3rd grade.
<br>
<br>
I have another interesting thought experiment, starting with this basis: Many scientists are trying to argue that reality has no basis in matter or energy, but information.
<br>
<br>
If the universe is some very optimized computer, then your "vision" of the reality around you, is simply another form of (incredibly fast, speed of light) communication. Like a language. We just use different mediums of language to exist. Wether it be art, the language we speak, texting, singing; All of this carries a meaning with it, but all of our human forms of communication are rather slow. Our fastest biological form of communication is our vision. For example, we can read a road sign from hundreds of feet away, and instantly get back information at the speed of light about the contents of that road sign. Imagine if you didn't have vision; You would need to walk up to the sign, use some sort of device to translate physical properties into a medium of language that you can interpret, such as braille. But as technology progresses, our technological mediums of communication also increase. Telegraph vs texting for example.
<br>
<br>
It's so incredible that our rather small biological brains can process so much visual information instantly, a really perplexing thought isn't it? It made me wonder how many other mediums of communication there are that we have yet to discover. This led me to discover an experiment where they installed and connected IR sensors into rat brains. What was found was incredible: The rat's brain integrated the new medium into the rat's conscious experience within a day. Rats with IR sensors could find food that had been giving off IR light, and the rats that didn't have them couldn't find the food. It leads me to believe that consciousness is like a tool, that maximizes the utility of the available information around you, by manifesting it into "experience".

<br>
<br>
I hope the structure of human psychology can make more sense to you when interpreted in this physics-based manner, because it it seems more clear to me when these abstractions are linked to physical phenomena. Please don't go make someone freak out by calculating which questions will trigger the biggest psychological tension in their mind. A statement that can very easily be true, and yet have no way of proving, is the equation of psychological terrorism. Hint: Religion.
