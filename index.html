<li>The purpose of this experiment is to track the psychological and thought patterns of development in myself during my life.

</li>
<li>Posted here will be thoughts and theories on controversial topics and paradoxes, to which I recognize as most compelling, in my mind; Answers to questions that everyone has thought about, yet nobody dares to answer.

Question 1: Why haven't aliens contacted us?
<br>

a modified Zoo hypothesis: The zoo hypothesis assumes first that a large number of alien cultures exist, and second that these aliens have great reverence for independent, natural evolution and development. In particular, assuming that intelligence is a physical process that acts to maximize the diversity of a system's accessible futures, a fundamental motivation for the zoo hypothesis would be that premature contact would "unintelligently" reduce the overall diversity of paths the universe itself could take.
<br>
<br>
Assuming these other alien civilizations are ages ahead of us in technology, they may already know that the survival of our universe in a multi-verse of realities relies on the number of quantum probabilities of the rest of the universe's timeline. If an alien civilization made contact with us, it would in theory "dumb us down" since instead of naturally discovering things through our human intelligence, we would just be cheating and using alien technology, a pre-discovered technology, therefore limiting/decreasing the possible futures of our reality.
<br>
<br>
These ideas are perhaps most plausible if there is a relatively universal cultural or legal policy among a plurality of extraterrestrial civilizations necessitating isolation with respect to civilizations at Earth-like stages of development. In a universe without a hegemonic power, random single civilizations with independent principles would make contact. This makes a crowded Universe with clearly defined rules seem more plausible.﻿
